Note that the last (rightmost) lane of both "Coomassie" and "UV" are folded (top gel) and unfolded (bottom gel) BLG,
pre-treated with NMM first, and then incubated with TME.

It is clear that pre-blocked unfolded BLG displayed no fluorescence but pre-blocked folded BLG still
displayed some fluorescence. This is because fully unfolded BLG can be fully blocked with NMM, but folded BLG 
cannot be fully blocked by NMM. Therefore, free Cys in folded BLG can still react with TME.

This result is not our focus of this project, so we did not explain this in detail in the main text and did not show
the last lane in Figure 2d.
